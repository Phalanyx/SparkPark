# Testing

We build our testing suite on Postman. We have created collections for the different parts of 
our application, including frontend and backend tests. We also included scripts to retrieve valifd authorization tokens for the reqeusts.

This ensures we can test our changes with this tests-suite and make sure everything is still working before merging branches or releasing features.
