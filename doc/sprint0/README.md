## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

The idea for Driveway Rentals was inspired by the need to address the challenges students face in finding affordable and convenient parking near their campuses.
With rising costs and limited parking spaces, many students struggle to manage their budgets while juggling their academic responsibilities. 
Driveway Rentals aims to provide an affordable and flexible parking solution by connecting students with local homeowners who have unused driveway space. 
This not only helps students save money but also fosters a sense of community and resource-sharing.
