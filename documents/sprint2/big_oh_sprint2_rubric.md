## Version Control (max 10 marks)

- Consistent Usage of Git (5 pt):
   - 2 pts: Regular and consistent commits demonstrating incremental progress in the project.
   - 2 pt:  Demonstrated proficiency in basic Git commands ((e.g., commit, push, pull, merge) and usage based on the contribution guidelines described by the team in their README.
   - 1 pts: Meaningful commit messages that convey the purpose of each change.

- Branches/Naming/Organization (5 pt)
   - 2 pts: Proper utilization of branches for feature development, bug fixes, etc. Should have feature branches for each user story that differs significantly in logic.
   - 2 pts: Use of Pull Requests and/or avoidance of direct uploads and merging zip files.
                 ● Should not directly commit each change to the main branch.
                 ● Should ideally merge branches using pull request feature on GitHub.
                 ● Should not manually merge zips from different branches in one local repo - bad practice
   - 1 pts: Clear and meaningful branch naming conventions that reflect the purpose of the branch.
