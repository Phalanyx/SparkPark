# BIG-OH

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Friday 14, 2025
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

In general the first sprint gave us a first experience in working on a project in a team. There where many things that did not go perfect from the beginning and a lot that can be taken away and learned from this first sprint. Additionally we all had to study for midterms during this sprint so our time to work on the project was more limited than it will be in future sprints.

#### Decisions that turned out well
- Defining team roles early on, so each person has a goal in mind. Altough this was sometimes difficult to do in early stage of development becasue of limited knowledge about the details of the project it really helped people to be able to work independently.  
- Setting up recurring meeting times often to have a consistent pacing and communication. Keeping communication by having regular meetings and not just writing messages enabled everyone to have an idea of the other team members progress and struggles and helped us to combine and structure the independent work. 
- Creating a shared planning document to have one central location to add ideas, process notes, and record meeting details. This enabled us to have a place to put down ideas, questions and considerations we would have to make in the future. It helped us have an overview on what is coming up in development in the future.


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
- Not setting up a meeting schedule immediately, which caused slight lag productivity during the start of the sprint as well as having to study for midterms. In general a pronlem for all of us was limited availability especially in the first week of the sprint. This delayed the start of development and therefore limited the scope of sprint1.
- Choosing an unfamiliar tech stack caused some delay in initialization for the group, but was resolved/is able to be resolved in a timely manner. (eg. unable to complete artifacts such as image upload).
- Designing shema for database without full knowledge of the exact implementation. Coming up with a schema for the database was difficult as we did not know how the exact implementation of all the features would look like. This was also due to the use of technologies not everyone is familiar with yet.


#### Planned changes

The changes we wanted to make like a regular meeting schedule have already been implemented over the first sprint so right now there is nothing we want to change in our process.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:
- As a user (spot finder or spot lister) I want to be able to signup/login. So that I can save my information, and enter it only once. (See user authentication flow artifact)
- As a parking customer I want to have a live map of available parking spots. So that I can find a parking spot suiting my needs. (See map listings component artifact)
- Basic database setup including schema.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

For the following goals, we have yet to get to them and will be completing them in the next sprint. 
- As a parking customer I want to be guaranteed that landlords are legit. So that I am guaranteed to get a parking spot when I rent one on the platform.
- As a parking customer I want to see a picture of the parking spot on the platform. So that I know I am parking at the right spot.
- As a customer, I want to be able to save/favourite listings so I can view them at a convenient place for the future.

We did not get to finish them as our time was especially limited for this sprint. 

## Meeting Highlights
- Ensure everyone is on the same page on what needs to be accomplished and what the big picture is, and keep up constant communication. Keeping yourself and each other accountable is as easy as sending a quick update or question to the other group members. This ensures that simple concerns can be addressed quickly and group meetings can be more concise or focused on other topics.
- Do relatively thorough checks of potential tools and tech before committing to them, in case of unexpected hitches (paywalls on tools, unfamiliarity and learning curves).
- More time commitment in future sprints where we have more availability. We will need to use the time we have for actually finishing our product over the semester, so if we have extra availability in future sprints we should invest this time into the current sprint.
