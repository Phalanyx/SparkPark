# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## What we plan to build

**[PRODUCT NAME]** is a web application that allows people to rent and sell parking lots. Many commuters, such as students and workers, often face high parking fees at designated parking spots. **[PRODUCT NAME]** connects local homeowners to drivers seeking a cheaper alternative for parking. This provides homeowners an opportunity to earn passive income while offering drivers a more affordable and convenient solution. While giving drivers the ability to easily find and navigate to parking spaces that fit their preferences. Gone are the days of driving around the block multiple times until you find a suitable parking spot. 
The platform focuses on making it easy for users to find, book and navigate to a parking space by automating the process of looking for a spot with auto-suggestions based on location and user-preferences. Therefore, enabling users to find a parking spot quickly and conviniently anywhere they are and at any time.  

We are developing a **responsive website and a mobile app** to ensure seamless access for all users. Features include:
- Searching for available parking spaces based on location, price, and distance and prefrence.
- Live Information of available, closeby parking spaces. 
- Navigation to parking spaces.
- Auto-suggestion of parking spaces.
- Securely booking spots in advance.
- Listing unused parking spots with availability, pricing, and location.

### Target Use Cases:
- **Students** struggling with high campus parking fees.
- **Professionals** seeking affordable downtown parking.
- **Travelers** spontaneously deciding at which place or for how long they want to park in areas they do not know.
- **Event-goers** attending concerts or sports games.
- **Property-Owners** having unused driveways or land that can serve as a parking spot and want to make some money on them.

With **long-term booking options**, users can secure spaces for weekly, monthly, or yearly use, making parking easier and stress-free.

## Why our product is innovative in the Parking Management Market
The Parking Management market is estimated to have a size of USD 5.67 billion in 2025. It is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.26% to reach USD 8.83 billion by 2030. Several factors that are fueling the market growth are the increasing rate of urbanization, global vehicle sales, the proliferation of mobile and smartphone devices, and the growing demand for seamless traffic flow. A big part of the market is "Parking Reservation Managent", this is an opportunity we want to capitalize on with our product.

The biggest actors in this market are companies like Amano McGann, deploying cloud-based parking accessibility and revenue process control systems. As these are not direct competitors to our product we will focus on smaller products that are closers competitors to our product in our market analysis.

**neighbor.com** and **parkify.ca** are both platforms that allow users to list and rent parking spots on an "Air BnB" like platform. 
The key differences to our product these platforms have are:
- Focus is on long-term rental agreements between car owners and landlords, while we focus on spontaneous and short-term renting agreements.
- Landlords are very professional, e.g. companies owning whole parking lots, while we also focus on more private parking spot owners who might only have a single lsiting.
- No navigation or suggestion of parking spots based on current location is available on the platform, while our product focuses on exactly this to make finding and booking a spot as easy as possible.

**SpotHero** is a mobile platform connecting landlords and car owners focusing on short-term parking agreements. The key differences to our product are:
- No option for "pay as you go" rental agreements, as parking spots are booked for a period set at time of booking.
- No auto-suggestion of parking spots based on location or preferences, which our app focuses on to make the finding, booking of a parking spot easy and quick.
- No live navigation to a booked parking spot, making it harder to find the parking spot you booked, especially if they are on private property.


## **Current Issues & Our Solutions:**
Universities and workplaces often exploit commuters by charging exorbitant prices for parking permits and daily parking fees, knowing that students and employees have limited alternatives. For example, the UTSC student parking pass has increased heavily in the past 4 years, as the current price for a Fall/Winter parking pass is $1300. These high costs add significant financial strain, especially for students already burdened with tuition and living expenses. Many commuters face the frustration of circling overcrowded lots, wasting time and fuel, only to be forced into expensive on-campus or corporate parking options. [PRODUCT NAME] aims to disrupt this system by offering an affordable, community-driven solution that connects drivers with homeowners willing to rent out unused parking spaces. By providing a cost-effective and convenient alternative, [PRODUCT NAME] empowers commuters to save money while also helping property owners generate passive income.
