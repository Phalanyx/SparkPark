# BIG-OH

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Friday 14, 2025
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

In general the first sprint gave us a first experience in working on a project in a team. There where many things that did not go perfect from the beginning and a lot that can be taken away and learned from this first sprint. Additionally we all had to study for midterms during this sprint so our time to work on the project was more limited than it will be in future sprints.

#### Decisions that turned out well
List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, turned out to be successful.
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why (i.e. give a supporting argument) you consider a decision to be successful.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).

- Defining team roles early on, so each person has a goal in mind 
- Setting up recurring meeting times often to have a consistent pacing and communication
- Creating a shared planning document to have one central location to add ideas, process notes, and record meeting details


#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped
List process-related (i.e. team organization) decisions that, in retrospect, were not as successful as you thought they would be.
 * 2 - 4 decisions.
 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Feel free to refer/link to process artifact(s).
- Not setting up a meeting schedule immediately, which caused slight lag productivity during the start of the sprint.
- Choosing an unfamiliar tech stack caused some delay in initialization for the group, but was resolved/is able to be resolved in a timely manner. (eg. unable to complete artifacts such as image upload)


#### Planned changes

List any process-related changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important.
 * Explain why you are making a change.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * Refer/link to artifact(s) that show that a goal/task was met/completed.
 * If a goal/task was not part of the original iteration plan, please mention it.
As a user (spot finder or spot lister) I want to be able to signup/login. So that I can save my information, and enter it only once. (See user authentication flow artifact)
As a parking customer I want to have a live map of available parking spots. So that I can find a parking spot suiting my needs. (See map listings component artifact)

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * From most to least important.
 * For each goal/task, explain why it was not met/completed.      
   e.g. Did you change your mind, or did you just not get to it yet?
For the following goals, we have yet to get to them and will be completing them in the next sprint. 
- As a parking customer I want to be guaranteed that landlords are legit. So that I am guaranteed to get a parking spot when I rent one on the platform.
- As a parking customer I want to see a picture of the parking spot on the platform. So that I know I am parking at the right spot.
- As a customer, I want to be able to save/favourite listings so I can view them at a convenient place for the future.


## Meeting Highlights
Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 * 2 - 4 items
 * Short (no more than one short paragraph per item)
 * High-level concepts that should guide your work for the next iteration.
 * These concepts should help you decide on where to focus your efforts.
 * Can be related to product and/or process.
- Ensure everyone is on the same page on what needs to be accomplished and what the big picture is, and keep up constant communication. Keeping yourself and each other accountable is as easy as sending a quick update or question to the other group members. This ensures that simple concerns can be addressed quickly and group meetings can be more concise or focused on other topics.
- Do relatively thorough checks of potential tools and tech before committing to them, in case of unexpected hitches (paywalls on tools, unfamiliarity and learning curves).
