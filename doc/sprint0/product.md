# YOUR PRODUCT/TEAM NAME

## Q1: What are you planning to build?

**[PRODUCT NAME]** is a web application that allows people to rent and sell parking lots. Many commuters, such as students and workers, often face high parking fees at designated parking spots. **[PRODUCT NAME]** connects local homeowners to drivers seeking a cheaper alternative for parking. This provides homeowners an opportunity to earn passive income while offering drivers a more affordable and convenient solution.
