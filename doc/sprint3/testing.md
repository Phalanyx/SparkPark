# Testing in sprint3

## Backend
 In the third sprint we extended our testing procedure. We added more tests to our postman 
 testing suite which test the functionality of all the backend routes. We now have a large
 testing suite that test the different components of our backend for the expected behaviour. We 
 included scripts to attach authentication tokens to the request wherever necessary to improve 
 the testing workflow.
